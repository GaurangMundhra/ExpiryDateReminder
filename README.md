## About

Expiry Date Reminder is an app created to help you keep track of expiry dates. 
Get reminded by notifications once something is expiring within 14 days.

This application has been created by Anish Sahoo, and has not been released under any license yet.

## Features

This app lets you:
- Add items with expiry dates

- View the list of items sorted by Item Name or by Expiration Date
- Choose between MM-DD-YYYY and DD-MM-YYYY formats

## Technicalities

- This application uses a local SQLite database with multiple tables to store everything
- Images are stored in the app's cached directory, ensuring that no one except the app can access the images
- The targeted API Level is 33 (Android 13), and the minimum API Level is 26 (Android 8.0)
- Java is the only language used in this application
- I have not used any external Third-party libraries except androidx & Material
